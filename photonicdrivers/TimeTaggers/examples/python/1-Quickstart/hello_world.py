"""Welcome to the Time Tagger examples!
In this first example we show how a simple, meaningful measurement can be implemented.
We use the built-in test signal within the Time Tagger.
The applied signal is the very same but has a fixed temporal shift depending on the channel used.
We will compensate for this delay and repeat the measurement to verify the compensation."""
